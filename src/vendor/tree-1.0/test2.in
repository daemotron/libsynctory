Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible
government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to
the people.  To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the
unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the
first task of the statesmanship of today.
-- President Theodore Roosevelt, 19 April 1906

We are grateful to the Washington Post, the New York Times, Time
magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended
our meetings and respected the promises of discretion for almost forty
years.  It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for
the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity
during those years.  But the world is now more sophisticated and
prepared to march towards a world government.  The supranational
sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely
preferable to the national auto-determination practised in past
centuries.
-- David Rockefeller, addressing the Trilateral Commission, 1991
